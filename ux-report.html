            <p>This report was completed with 3 other classmates as one of the UX/UI assignments for the BCIT Technical Web Design Program. The purpose of this report was to help me in understanding the fundamentals of planning and delivering a Usability Test.

            <h2>The Process</h2>
            <p>The instructor placed everyone in different groups and every group had to pick a site from a list to test and report on. My group ended up picking Lululemon. The requirements for this report was to understand who the ideal users are by creating personas, create questions (pre/post and tasks), and assign different roles to the group members for the usability test. I took on the observer role and was responsible for watching the behavior of the participant and taking notes.</p>

            </div>

            <p>Although Lululemon has already established themselves as on of the top brands in Canada, we thought that having a functioning and well-designed website should still be one of their main priorities since e-commerce can greatly influence sales nowadays. The whole evaluation was split into three sections: pre-survey, tasks to complete, and post-survey. The pre-test and post-test survey were completed on a Google form. The pre-test consisted of general questions about the participants such as their gender, income, how often they work out...etc. During the tasks and scenarios, the participants either did a click test, 5 second test, or completed a task on the website.</p>

                <img src="./images/google-form.png" alt="Lululemon Google Form">
                <img src="./images/google-form2.png" alt="Lululemon Google Form">
            </div>
            
            <p>I researched a lot of common usability testing questions and took in consideration of what type of tasks were appropriate and suitable for Lululemon. One particular thing that stood out for me while browsing through their website was their <i>Sales</i> section. They named it as <i>We made too much</i>, which I found a bit vague and confusing. To see if other people felt the same, I included the task of finding the sales section in the test. Although we've only tested 4 particpants, the results showed that it was indeed quite confusing.</p>

            <h2>What Can Be Improved:</h2>
            <ul class="improvelist">
                <li>Add a short and clear description of the persona user type - such as "Young Urban professional - Female"</li>
                <li>Add more severity to analysis</li>
                <li>Rather than simply record behavior, evaluate the reasons behind the behavior can be helpful as well</li>
                <li>Have more open-ended questions</li>
                <li>Write more specific task scenarios to engage testers</li>
