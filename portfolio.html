        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <p>Working as a team and dealing with real clients has widened my perspective on web development. Planning out the whole website and gathering the necessary information from the client was a lot more difficult than I imagined. From understanding the purpose of the site, building the information architecture, to planning out wireframes and style tiles, I understood the complexity and amount of effort that goes into website development.</p>

        </div>
        <p>During a the meeting with Roberta, we showed her a few colour palettes and asked her to pick some colors that she liked. We noticed that she preferred cold colour palettes such as blue and green, so we styled the website using variations of those colors to give a professional but also friendly and approachable feel.
        <div class="colorpalette">
            <div class ="colorbox"></div>
            <div class ="colorbox"></div>
            <div class ="colorbox"></div>
            <div class ="colorbox"></div>
        </div>
        <p>A big part of this project was customizing the back-end of wordpress to suit the needs of Roberta. She wanted to have the ability to not only add blog posts, but also change other sections of the web page, such as adding services. We made custom post types, taxonomies and fields.</p>
