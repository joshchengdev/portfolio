                <p>Vulcan was the first web group project that I’ve ever done, which required the use of Git. The purpose of this site was to practice my HTML and CSS skills. I was given a mockup of what the website should look like and was asked to build it from scratch. This was also the first time I’ve used SASS on a big project. This single page website was completed by Hannah and I. Although both of us have never worked together, the process went really smoothly since we were both organized and knew what was needed to be done. Thanks Hannah!<br>

            <h2>The Process</h2>
            <p>As I was styling through the website, I realized how useful and convenient SASS was. Using variables for specific sizes, colors, and media queries were extremely helpful and time efficient since a lot of the styles on the website followed a similar pattern. I didn't really get to explore of the different type of things that SASS offers since the time given to complete this project was quite short, however, I picked up a few basic features, such as variables, nesting and importing. Here are some variables that Hannah and I used for this website.</p>
