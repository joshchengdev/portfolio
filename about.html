<h1>about</h1>
<div class = "about-content">
    <p>I am a front-end web developer based in Vancouver. I love to keep up with the latest trends and create awesome websites that can connect and communicate effectively with the visitor.</p>   
    <p>If I had to describe what kind of web developer I am in a short sentence, I like to think myself as a strategically lazy person; I try to avoid writing repetitive code, be as organized as possible by making short and precise comments as well as anticipate future needs by writing future proof code. I also love working in teams because I believe that teamwork not only accomplishes the best results, but also facilitates the sharing of knowledge and experiences. </p>  
    <p>I grew up in Vancouver, but I was born in Taiwan. I speak fluent Mandarin and can read and write Chinese. I graduated from Simon Fraser University with a BA in economics and completed the Technical Web Design program at BCIT. I also love dogs and cats.</p>
