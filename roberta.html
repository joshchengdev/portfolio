            <p>Roberta is a passionate Canadian writer who provides a large range of writing services and interviews various
                people who are in the film industry. I came into contact with Roberta through the BCIT TWD program and chose
                her as my first client project. The purpose of this site was to promote Roberta's writing services as well
                as a place for her to share stories. Rebeca, Felix, and I completed this project in one month.

            <h2>The Process</h2>
            <p>Working as a team and dealing with real clients has widened my perspective on web development. Planning out the
                whole website and gathering the necessary information from the client was a lot more difficult than I imagined.
                From understanding the purpose of the site, building the information architecture, to planning out wireframes
                and style tiles, I understood the complexity and amount of effort that goes into website development.</p>
            <div class="multiple-images">
                <img src="./images/ia.jpg" alt="Post it notes">
                <img src="./images/wireframes.jpg" alt="Wireframe sketches">
            </div>
            <p>During a the meeting with Roberta, we showed her a few colour palettes and asked her to pick some colors that
                she liked. We noticed that she preferred cold colour palettes such as blue and green, so we styled the website
                using variations of those colors to give a professional but also friendly and approachable feel.
            </p>
            <p>A big part of this project was customizing the back-end of wordpress to suit the needs of Roberta. She wanted
                to have the ability to not only add blog posts, but also change other sections of the web page, such as adding
                services. We made custom post types, taxonomies and fields.</p>
            <div class="multiple-images">
                <img src="./images/roberta-function2.png" alt="Custom Post Type function">
                <img src="./images/roberta-function1.png" alt="Custom taxonomies">
            </div>
            <p>Aside from asking peers and instructors, googling and looking for different solutions on stack overflow really
                helped me learned a lot while I was working on this project. Since this website was built with WordPress,
                there were multiple times that I had to look whether if there was a built-in PHP function or some other solution
                in he WordPress codex or on google. Although I didn't always get to find the answer that I was looking for,
                this project really helped me practice how to Google effectively as a developer, such as understanding what
                keywords I should be using or just simply being able to explain what my question is in a way that everyone
                can understand easily. The internet is the biggest library there is, so although being able to remember things
                about programming is ideal, the ability to be able to quickly and efficiently find what you are looking for
                is important as well.</p>
