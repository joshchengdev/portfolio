        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <p>I started off by looking at other successful web developers' portfolio website to see if there was a general pattern or structure that I could learn from. I noticed that a portfolio should not only demonstrate what kind of things that I can do, but also show some personality. I typed out the content that I wanted to have in a word document at first, then made a wireframe on Adobe XD to get a general idea of where to put the content. Preparing the content took a big longer than I expected since I have to go through all of my past work and decide which ones are more suitable for the portfolio. In addition to deciding, I also had to write details and gather images for those selected work.</p>

        <p>CSS animations is something that I've always had interest in. This might be due to the fact that I love watching animated films and shows. Being able to creat fluid and logical animation is one of my goals as a web developer, so I decided to incorporate animations in this portfolio. I wanted to create something that represented me as a web developer, so I made this sketch-like illustration of a person working in the dark with the light from the screen flickering. Yes. I like to work in the dark with no lights on. </p>
