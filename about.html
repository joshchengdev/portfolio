            <p>My name is Josh and I am a <span class ="highlight">front-end web developer</span> based in Vancouver.</p>
            <p>I love to keep up with the latest trends and create <span class ="highlight">awesome</span> websites that can connect and communicate effectively with the visitor. If I had to describe what kind of web developer I am in a short sentence, I like to think myself as a <span class ="highlight">strategically lazy person</span>; I try to avoid writing repetitive code, be as organized as possible by making short and precise comments as well as anticipate future needs by writing future proof code. I also love working in teams because I believe that <span class ="highlight">teamwork</span> not only accomplishes the best results, but also facilitates the sharing of knowledge and experiences. I completed the  <span class ="highlight">Technical Web Design program</span> at BCIT in 2018 and also graduated from SFU with a BA in <span class ="highlight">economics</span>. I grew up in Vancouver, but I was born in Taiwan. I speak fluent Mandarin and can read and write Chinese.</p>
            <p>Check out my <a href="./index.html#works">work</a> to see more details of my projects, or if you're just interested in knowing more about me, feel free to contact me at <span class="highlight">abc@abc.com</span></p>
